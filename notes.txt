-You can't have more than one structural directives
attached to one element.
ex- <!-- <li
          class="list-group-item"
          *ngFor="let number of numbers"
          *ngIf="number % 2 == 0">
          {{ number }}
        </li> -->

-You can use squarebracets surrounding the directive only 
when the name of the property or alias is same as that of 
directive. And then you will have to use the following syntax.
for example- 
<p [appBetterHighlight]="'red'" [defaultColor]="'yellow'">Style me with Better directive!</p>
@Input('appBetterHighlight') highlightColor: string = 'blue';

NOTE- If you are using property binding, and passing a string inside "" marks.
Then you can use the following syntax-
[defaultColor]="'yellow'"  -------->> defaultColor="yellow"
